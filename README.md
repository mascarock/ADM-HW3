This homework is realised by:

- Gabriele Giannotta 1909375
- Masoumeh Shariat 1916321
- Niccol√≤ Mascaro

We have these files: 

- A jupyter file, **main.ipynb**, containing the answers to all the questions. It is named main.ipynb.
- A python file, **collector.py**, containing the code which enabled us to download the webpages.
- A python file, **collector_utils.py**, containing the functions used in *collector.py*.
- A python file, **parser.py**, containing the code which enabled us to parse the webpages.
- A python file, **parser_utils.py**, containing the functions used in *parser.py*.
- A python file, **utils.py**, containing all the functions we used in this homework.
- A python file, **main.py**, containing the 3 search engines. This one will be used during the oral exam.
- A python file, **exercise_4.py**, containing the code used for the fourth part of the homework.

We don't have these files: 

- A python file, **index.py**, containing the code which enabled us to create the inverted index for each of the 3 search engines.
- A python file, **index_utils.py**, containing the functions used in *index.py*.

We tried to write all questions completely. But unfortunately it failed. Although we have a plan to complete it.
